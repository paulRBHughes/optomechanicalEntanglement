OTHER RELEVANT FILES
coolingutils.py: Contains the functions that execute the RK4 for the BTS
utils.py: Contains the functions that execute the RK4 for the 2MSTS
optGSolver.py: uses the analytic expression to determine the optimal g value
anticorrelations.py: looks at the correlation maxima briefly discussed in Sec V
optimalPumpMovie.py: makes an animation from fig 12 like data for different zeta values


OTHER FILES NOT ABOVE
ghostfromSS.py, ghostfromSSanimations.py, ghostSNR.py: abandoned ghost imaging simulations based on 2MSTS
minimumTemp.py: numerical simulation of cooling that is just determined analytically in Sec III
2MSTSsim.py: simulates a 2MSTS initially in a thermal state
slopes.py: Deprecated. Simulated the bathless equations for a wide zeta at a particular population, without changing IC
plottingSlopes,py: Deprecated. Plotted data from above
pumpComp.py: Compares different pump envelopes for the entanglement process
relSim.py: Broken. Early testing of the effect of starting the 2MSTS process below equilibrium
